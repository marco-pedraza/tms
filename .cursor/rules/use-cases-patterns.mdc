# Use Case Patterns

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED**: This pattern is deprecated. Use **Entity Pattern** instead for domain entities with complex business logic. See `AGENTS.md` for current patterns.

For new features, use Entity Pattern (standard for domain entities) as documented in `AGENTS.md`.

Existing use cases should be gradually refactored to Entity Pattern when possible.
